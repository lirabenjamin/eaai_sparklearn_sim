Student: I'm really struggling with this Venn diagram question.

Tutor: I'm here to help. Can you tell me what you understand from the question?

Student: From what I understand there're two circles, one inside the other. The bigger one represents multiples of a number they call the 'triangle'. The circle within that one, a subset, represents multiples of a number called 'square'.

Tutor: That's correct. The key is to understand that all multiples of the 'square' number are also multiples of the 'triangle' number. Can you try to apply that concept to the options provided?

Student: I see... Well, looking at the options... I'm not sure. I picked A as my answer because 12 is a multiple of 8. But the system said it's wrong.

Tutor: 12 is indeed a multiple of 8, but remember, the smaller circle, 'square', is a subset of the larger circle, 'triangle'. So we need to find a 'triangle' number that all multiples of the 'square' number also are multiples of. Another approach is to look for an option where 'triangle' is a divisor of 'square'. 

Student: Ok, I think I understand now. Looking at the answers again... I think the answer might be D. Is that correct?

Tutor: Yes, that's correct! Option D means every multiple of 8 is also a multiple of 4, which fits the Venn diagram. Well done for figuring that out!
