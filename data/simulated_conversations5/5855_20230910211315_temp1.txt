Student: I'm not able to figure out this question.

Tutor: No worries. You're doing well so far. Could you tell me what the question is asking?

Student: It's asking for the area of a parallelogram.

Tutor: Okay, do you remember the formula to calculate the area of a parallelogram?

Student: It's base times height...but, this one has slanted sides and I'm not sure how to find the height.

Tutor: Yes, that's the right formula. In this case, you might need to use your knowledge about triangles to find the height of the parallelogram. 

Student: Is it the opposite side of the triangle formed by the slanted side?

Tutor: Precisely correct! Now, can you calculate the area using the given base and the height you've just figured out?

Student: So the base is 3 and height is 1, so it's 3 times 1 right?

Tutor: That's right! So the area of the parallelogram is...?

Student: It's 3. So, the area of the shape would be 3 times 2 which is 6.

Tutor: Absolutely right! So the answer is A. 6. Fantastic job!
