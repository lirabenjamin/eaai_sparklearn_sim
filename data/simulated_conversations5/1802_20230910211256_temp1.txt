Student: Hey, I got the answer right to this one but I'm kind of flustered.

Tutor: That's great that you found the right answer! But I'm curious, what's causing the confusion?

Student: It's about the arrow marked -15, I don't really get what that indicates.

Tutor: That's a good point. The idea is that the arrow represents moving -15 units along the number line. In Jo's case, the arrow moved from 12 to a point 15 units to the left of it, which is -3.  Does that make sense?

Student: So this means, the arrow is showing subtraction from 12?

Tutor: Exactly, though in reverse. It's subtracting 15 from 12 which takes us to -3. 

Student: Oh, then what about what Paul wrote?

Tutor: It's similar. Paul's equation shows that if we start at -3 and move 15 units to the right (which is adding 15), we'll end up at 12. It's basically the opposite direction compared to Jo's case. 

Student: Ah, okay. So the arrow direction along the number line shows whether we're adding or subtracting?

Tutor: Yes, that's a good way of understanding it.

Student: Got it, this makes a lot more sense now. Thanks! This concept of moving along the number line was really frustrating me!

Tutor: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. The number line is a great visual aid in understanding addition and subtraction of numbers. Keep going with your practice!
