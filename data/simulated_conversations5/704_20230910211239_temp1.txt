Student: This question, I can't really understand how to find the temperature difference.

Tutor: Sure thing! Can you tell me how you're trying to solve it? 

Student: I don't know, I guess I'm supposed to subtract, but the negative temperatures are confusing me...

Tutor: I see where the confusion is. Remember, we are trying to find the difference between two temperatures. So, we need to subtract. But if a number is negative? 

Student: Then I guess we should add it instead? 

Tutor: Exactly! So if we want to find the difference between 1pm on Thursday (+7) and 1am on Wednesday (-4), how would we do that?

Student: Hmm.. so instead of subtracting the -4, I add it to 7? 

Tutor: Right! So what's your final calculation?

Student: So it would be 7 -(-4), is that the same as 7+4?

Tutor: Yes, that's correct! You've got it.

Student: Ahh, got it! Thanks for your help, I think I understand these temperature problems better now.
