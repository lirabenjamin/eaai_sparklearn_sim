Student: Hi, I am a bit unsure about this problem. 

Tutor: That's okay, can you tell me where you are getting stuck?

Student: Sure, I'll write it down this way: (3)^2 + (-16) [blank] (-5)^2. I know how to solve the squares but I am uncertain about the relation between them.

Tutor: Good job solving the squares. Now, what do you get when you solve them?
 
Student: (3)^2 becomes 9, and (-5)^2 becomes 25.

Tutor: Right, now how about the -16?

Student: Well, 9 plus negative 16 becomes negative 7.

Tutor: Great! Now compare negative 7 to 25. What symbol would make this sentence correct?

Student: The symbol should be less than, right? Because -7 is less than 25.

Tutor: Excellent! That's exactly correct. So, the answer is less than represented as "<". Well done!
