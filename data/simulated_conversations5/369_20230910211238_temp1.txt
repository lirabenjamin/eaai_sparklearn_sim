Student: Um, I guess I kind of understand this problem, but I'm not fully sure about my answer.

Tutor: That's okay! Could you tell me what answer you chose?

Student: I chose C. It was (4 - 2) x 3 = 6.

Tutor: That's correct! Can you explain how you decided on that answer?

Student: Well, I saw the -2 and then the x3 on the graphic. I thought I have to do subtraction first then multiplication.  

Tutor: Yes, you're right. The actions in the graphic were done in sequence, which is represented well by the parentheses in Option C. Great job! 

Student: But, uh, can you explain why the other options are incorrect? 

Tutor: Absolutely. Options A and D incorrectly put the multiplication before the subtraction, and option B lacks any parentheses which can imply different order of operations depending on mathematical convention. Putting the parentheses around the subtraction in option C, like you chose, guarantees the correct order. 

Student: Okay, I think I understand it better now. Thanks.
