Student: I think the question might be wrong. How can 8 square be a part of data representation?

Tutor: Good observation. But in this case, the question is focusing on the basic math operation, which is squaring a number. It's the underlying math concept that's often used in data and statistics.

Student: Oh, I see. So it's about squaring 8?

Tutor: Yes, exactly. Do you remember how to square a number? 

Student: I think it means multiplying the number by itself, right? So it should be 8 times 8.

Tutor: You're correct. That's the way to square a number. 

Student: So, it should be 64?

Tutor: That's right! Well done! The square of 8 is indeed 64, so the answer is B. Keep up the good work!
