Student: I really thought I was going to get this one wrong but it turns out my answer was correct.

Tutor: That's excellent! Your answer did turn out to be correct. And I notice your confidence in this question was 100%. Why were you worried?

Student: I guess because the other student's measurements were close to 96 too, and it got me second-guessing.

Tutor: Ah, I understand how seeing those other options could cause some uncertainty. Can you explain why you chose 96 over the others?

Student: It's because I just decided to trust what the protractor was showing.

Tutor: That sounds like a very logical approach! So you made use of the information given directly by the protractor. Trusting the tools is often a good way to go. Is there anything about this question that you're still unsure about?

Student: Not really, I suppose I just need more confidence in my answers. But I think I'm getting the hang of it now.

Tutor: Wonderful! Trusting in your understanding is crucial. And remember, it's okay to be unsure sometimes. That's part of learning. You're doing great, ready for the next problem?
